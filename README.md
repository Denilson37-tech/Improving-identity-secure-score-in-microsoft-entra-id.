Improving Identity Security Posture in Microsoft Entra ID

This project demonstrates the assessment and hardening of identity security posture in a Microsoft Entra ID environment, with a focus on improving the tenant's Identity Secure Score. 

Initially, the tenant displayed a Secure Score of approximately 15%, indicating weak identity hygiene, multiple unresolved security recommendations, and limited administrative redundancy. 

Such gaps represent common risks in small to mid-sized organizations and can lead to account compromise or administrative lockout if left unaddressed.

The main issues identified included a Secure Score significantly below industry baseline expectations, risky default identity configurations, multiple active recommendations, and limited administrative redundancy. Addressing these gaps required careful planning to improve security without disrupting legitimate access or business operations.

Actions taken included reviewing all Secure Score recommendations in Microsoft Entra ID, prioritizing critical tenant-level identity hardening actions, and strengthening administrative access redundancy.

All changes were verified against Microsoft risk guidance to ensure alignment with recommended security practices. Efforts focused on reducing exposure to identity-based attacks while maintaining operational stability.

As a result, the tenant's Identity Secure Score improved from 15% to 75% within 24 hours, with multiple recommendations addressed and administrative risk mitigated. 

The environment now reflects a stronger baseline for identity security, reducing the likelihood of credential compromise and supporting safer administrative operations.

This project highlights the ability to assess and improve identity posture using Microsoft Entra ID, demonstrating practical implementation of security controls, understanding of identity risk beyond default settings, and measurable improvements in security posture. 

It reflects enterprise-level thinking by balancing risk mitigation with operational continuity and serves as evidence of capability in identity security for cloud environments.

Evidence includes the updated Identity Secure Score and verification of addressed recommendations, showing tangible improvement in security controls. Identity remains the primary attack surface in cloud environments, and addressing these gaps proactively prevents common exploits while demonstrating the ability to deliver meaningful security improvement
