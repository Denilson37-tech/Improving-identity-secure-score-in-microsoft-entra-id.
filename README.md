Improving-identity-secure-score-in-microsoft-entra-id.

overview

This project focuses on improving the identity secure score in a microsoft entra id test tenant. initially, the tenant had a secure score of approximately 15%, showing weak identity hygiene and multiple unresolved recommendations. after applying selected identity hardening actions, the score improved to 75% within 24 hours.
This demonstrates practical identity security at a junior cloud security level.

Problem

identity secure score far below baseline (~45%)

limited administrative redundancy

risky default identity configurations

multiple active recommendations

these are common gaps in small organizations or lab environments, and they can lead to account compromise or admin lockout.

Actions taken

reviewed identity secure score recommendations directly in microsoft entra id

applied selected tenant-level identity hardening actions

strengthened administrative access redundancy

verified changes against microsoft risk explanations

changes were applied carefully to avoid breaking access while improving security posture.

Result

identity secure score increased from 15% to 75% within 24 hours

multiple recommendations moved to addressed

reduced exposure to basic identity-based attacks

environment now reflects a stronger identity baseline.

What this demonstrates

ability to assess identity posture using secure score

understanding of identity risk, not just settings

practical junior-level cloud security implementation

measurable security improvement in a short timeframe

Evidence

current identity secure score screenshot (75%)

recommendations marked as addressed

Why this matters

identity is the primary attack surface in cloud environments. fixing identity gaps early prevents easy access exploits and shows that even at a junior level, i can deliver real security improvements.
